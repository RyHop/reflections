 This is a new reflection file started for android Development. I have one hand-written, so I will keep updating that as well. But, I will update this one also to keep my skillset with git and github.

  Firstly, I need to learn how to use git and github with Android Studio. I will figure out when the time comes. I figure I can just create a repository and clone the package...hopefully.

  One of the things I learned today was the class R.id or R.layout..or I believe just "R"...its a reference for the resource folder..so thats why, when refering to a textview or string such as R.findViewByID.idk....its is refering to that.

  Mabye I should start dating these. (15 December 2017).
  I learned how to create an array in java. Something like Strings [] toyname = 'a'. It is very confusing when doings that instead of doing it in python, but I will manage. Also, in the Udacity tutorial, I got the Strings array from a class method from another file. Example: Strings [] toyname = toys.toyNames();. When I started android development in Java 4 or 5 years ago, I did not know what oys.toyNames() would come from. Now, I do. I learned a little something from classes in my intro to programming class, and it all makes sense now. When I looked at the Java class that I got the list of strings from, I can simply see myself doing it....Times have changed!

  I just want to reflect about adding a scroll view. It makes your content scroll. Its simply just adding a scroll view widget around the text view that we made equal an array of strings. That's it. It is not different textviews together. Huh..But I bet there is a different way of doing it. We will find out.

  Just checking in with the strings resource folder. I haven't been using this, but I should if I want my app to translate to other languages. I found that to make a string in the resource folder, just add one like the app name before..and the id is in quotations marks. If want to use, say on the XML layout, just put in quotations, @Strings/value. That is it.

  Maybe I will do alot of reflection now, because I am getting thick into the code. So, I created a menu to be put on the taskbar. I created an item in main.xml(new menu resource file in menu resource folder). The <item contained android:title attribute, app:showAsAction="ifRoom" attribute, android:orderInCateogry="1" if you have multiple, and android:id to reference it in code.
  Now the weird thing in code is that I did not know what I was doing at first. I was writing onCreateOptionsMenu..oh nvm, I guess this method is called when the Activity starts. Then I inflated using getMenuinflator().infalate(R.menu.main,menu). Then i returned true. 
  For the menuinflator.inflate parameters, I can only guess the reference main menu is an integer recognized by Android Studio, and the second paramter is menu..just saying its a menu. 
  In the onOPtionsItemSelected method(), I know this is clicked when an option has been selected in menu. I got the viewId by intializing it to item.getItemID(). So, it is a property of item I believe. Then I made a TOast to confirm what I clicked. I love toats! Easy and Simple. Aftwardwards, I return the super command which I believe just tells the method that you can go ahead and show the menu..the code following does not matter.

  It took me approximately an hour to understand the URI class. I was not about the .appendParameter because I simply did not know what I was looking at and how to use it. In general, I understand that the URI builder is for using URL in code which we translate into a JAVA URL after using the URI builder. In the URI builder, I just know you have your base URL, your parameters or extra wierd lookin codes in the URL, and you build it afterwards.
  After I was done building the URI and translating it to a URL, I created a method which took the github query (used in making the URI building)and sent it to the URI builder. Once done, I dispalyed the URL ona textview. Maybe that was this whole thing was about. Asking the user what data to query on github, and building the url to search using a HTTP Request. That is most likely it, but I do not know how the githubquery is put together in the URI builder. I will know soon, if I need to know further information. But now, move on :)

  More on Connection to the internet. Now, We are using a HttpURLConnection which allows us to actually connect to the internet. It is not much acually. First, make an open connection. Secondly, use an InputStream to get to the text. Third, use a scanner and use a ".useDelimiter("\\A") to allow different sizes of data and ensure flawless connection. Lastly, disconnect.
  Next is permission. I pretty much know about those through previous apps.

  (17 December 2017)
  I just finished the "Connecting to Internet" course on Udacity. What a course! My mind is blanc, confused trying to learn all those things. It's good. Firstly, I understand the URI, and HTTPURLConnection methods. I just probably have to look them up to use them, but at least I know of them and their functionality. I can't remember them off my brain though.
  I learned AyncsTask or something spelled like that. It's mainly for switching calculations and processes off the main thread which is important for efficient app transistions. I understand mostly how to do it, but its a lot to remember off the top of my head. 
  I understand how to create a menu item and do something if clicked really well.
  I learned how the Error message work, show or hide data, and making a progess bar.
  And finally, I  understand how to parse JSON data by hand. 

  If I had to completely misunderstannd one concept in this lesson, it would be some of the classes Udacity wrote without explaininng . COmments in the code said "it will be taught in a future lesson" or what was the broad meaning of that ccode.

  Just reflecting on RecyclerView before I move on to other stuff. So, a Recycleview is for a clearner, more efficient solution to displaying views in a list on a screen without initilizing each view in code and haven to call them multiple times if scrolling. First, You compile a dependicy. You can find it with a google search. Then, you create the layout file. Once done, in a java file, create a class that extends the Recyle View..or I believe its the ViewHolder. Then build the constrtuctor that initaties the views you want. This is all from my understanding.
  Just another commit. So, there is recycelingView, adapter, and layoutmanagers. Thats it on a higher level. Recycleing view is in charge of reusing views, adapater is for the data, and the layoutmanger is designed for orientation. I already touched on making the recycleingView. Making the adapter is the same way without the layout making. Just extend a java class and load the overriding methods, and the layout inflator I believe. The layoutmanager can be done in the main class with a simple initialization.
  For the Recyecler View...just make the layout, intiilize it, set the adapter, and the layoutmanager. You should be good.
  So when creating the recycler view, create the xml file, compile the dependeciy, initizlize and reference it in the main activity class.
  For the adapter, extend it in a java file class. "RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder>, take in any parameters, create a blass that extends viewHolder, define your views or widgets in that viewHOlder, create onCreateViewHolder(Override) and inflate the layout, provide a contructor for the adapte, and finally, create a onBindViewHolder to update the views.

  Learning Intents. I have already learned enough to make my previous app, so I can breeze through this lesson. But, it is nice to know implicit intents which opens a camera or call someone. It basically performs an action and it doesn't matter what app executses it. Also, opening a webpage is easy. just make it a URI, parse it with Uri, and then put it into an intent. 
  URi is bascially a broader URL. it has a scheme:http, host:www.google.com, path: /courses, queory: q=Money, and/or fragment: #something. Those are the components.
  Build Uri class makes more sense with them explaining how to show a location on the map using an intent. I can google search common intents by the way to help explain it. Then, process to build Uri as suggested with the intent.

  Now, I am doing the lesson about Android life cycles. I pretty much know half of the information by working with one of my previous apps. Though, I did not know tbout Loaders and SaveInstanceState. Interesting. SaveInstanceState is when you save data if the current android lifecycle is interrupted. Loader helps keep the current async task up to date or searching for a URL if orientation of the phone switches in between causing a change of states.
  With a loader, create a loader ID, Fill-in loader Callbacks or override methods, and finally Initizlize the loader with loaderManager.
  Also, to cache the Loader data, create a member variable, modify onStartLoading to call deliverResult, and then Override deliverResult to store data in the cache member variable.

   In the preferences lesson of Udacity. Learned about SharedPrefances, cloud, google firebase, servers, and internal/external file. CORRECTION: I did not learn about them about I now know the ways of storing files in Android. Also, I know of fragments in the past, but they have always been a confusion with me. Now, I know there are an activity, but a mini one. They perform the same option, but a piece of the screen. You don't want the whole activity on there. For settings, there is a thing call preference fragment.

   When making a settings menu..its not hard really. Create a settings class. Create a menu usually. Ovvride all methods. Create an XML file for the preference fragment or the settings you want. Create a fragment item in the settings activity. In the preference fragment java `=class, extend the prefeancefragmentcompat, and then overrid ethe methods. Also, DONT FORGET TO ADD DEPENDICY. Finally, addPrefrecene latyout in the fragemetn java class or in the only override method (onCreate), and add a prefrence theme in the style resource folderor it wont work.

   onSharePreferenceManager can be used to update stuff regardless of lifecycle. Implement it in the right class, register and unregister, and use dafaultsharedpreferences or sharedpreferesnces method, or the one that is overrided.
   You can use list preference as well, for example: show color
   To update the hint, use onPreferenceChangeListoner and Preference Summary.
   PreferenceChangedListoner gets called as soon as the setting is changes. SharedPreferncedChangedListoner is called when aything setting is changed.
   First Choice, you can override the home button, to only go back. Also, use android launch mode to concerve memory so the activity wont start again.

   When Creating an SQLite database, it is the same as any other database: rows, columns, and is relational. First a create a contract in Android. There is an example online. 
   When creating a contract, create an inner class with implementing BaseColumns. Then, declare strings for tables and columns.
   Now, Create Waitlist DbHelper by new Java Class and extend SQLiteOpen Helper. Delcare strings: version number and name of database.
   Make a constructor or implement it..then call super to let the bigger class take care of everything. Dont forget context! Implremnet onCreate and onUpgrade.
   onCreate justs create SQL statement. 
   OnUpgrade drops the database and recreates it.
   To query all guests, create a method that returns a cursor. Its in the main class. Call it in onCreate and pass the cursor count to the adapter that returns data and handles the recycler view. 
   Update the adapter to reflect the new count in the list.
   Update the adapter for the entire cursor.
   Bind the cursor data in onVindViewHolder
   Update MainActivity to pass in the cursor.
   Too add guests..get the data from the UI. Implement addToWaitlist and call addNewGuest. Create and Implement addGuest to insert into the DB.
   Okay, now it seems I may be a little lost or not fullly learning. Its okay. I can see myself goign back to this as a reference. Once day, I will be able to do all this myself. So, to remove geusts, create a method, get an id tag for the deleted targets, update the adapter, use ItemTouchHelper for swipping guests.

 Today or tonight, I am learning ContentProvider. It helps access data within your app in a secure way, and it allows for other apps to use the same data. Say you get a contact info in ur app, to secure it in the dafault phone app, u need a content provider. To use it: get permission, get the content resolver, pick a basic action--query,insert, update, or delete; identiy the data you are reading or manipulintg to create a URI, and in case of reading from ContentProvider, display the info to UI. Teses are the directions from Udacity before they show me the tutorial. 
 ContentResolver gets the data..it acts as an efficient middle man.
 Then use a query method on the contentresolver to specity you only reading the objects...other functions are write,slect and update i believe.
 Use the cursor methods such as getColumnIndex and get string to get the data stored.

 (29 December 2017)
  Right now, I am learning how to creat a ContentProvider. First, I know i need to create a java class extending content providers and implremnitng onCreate. Next, registor the provider in the manifest.
  Now, I am learning URI structures again: path, authority, and schema. Now, I am learning the Wildcard Characters such as '#'.
  # = matches'path' followed by a number
  * = matches 'path' followed by a string.
  Remember, the contract is designed to keep track of constants used in data classes or whenever u need it.
  To get data from the task content provider, i needed a URI for the whole table..then the single task. Writing it down helps me wrap my head around it. 
  BUILD the final content URI in the implemented BaseColumns class. BUILD is special because it uses the method buildUpon() and appendPath.
  Building the URIMactcher, it is just to see which URI the provider receives...aka all tasks or one task. Can use a SWITCH statement. 
  Build the URIMacher method..look it up. Then addUri.
  Set something equal to the return value.
  Now in the content provider, I need to implement the CRUD methds...insert, query, update, and delete.

  Maybe I knew more about Android Development did I thought. I am learning background services. I could also use a Loader for the same task but the loader is different by directly using the main thread, updating the current UI, and cannot be used in backgrounds. With service, there also exists a subclass called Intent servies. It handles a specific job. Services are just more broad. 
  Don't forget to put the service in Android Manifest.
  I probably need to go over sharedPreferenceInstance Again.
  Pending intents allow outside influences to lauch activities in ur app. Also, there are alot of new stuff in Android OREO. If Android Oreo, use a notification channel.
  Notification.Action is required for buttons or any view in the notifications.
  Foreground services are absoultely services that requires attention..Priority of critical.
  Scheduling Jobs can be done by FirebaseJobDispatcher.
  Broadcast Receivers is triggered by outside influence. What intents will trigger it. Jobs can be used if apps isnt started...for instance, a job while charging. For broadcast recievers when the app is runnign, dynamic broadcasts are good. Statis is for offline usually.
  Android has a batteryManager!

  In lessone 11 learning "Completing the UI." The new stuff I learned was Hierachy Viewer, vector images, and the reasoning behind constraint layouts. Vector images are for easily scalable images for apps. Hierachy Viewer helps analyze the views in the layout which shows a tree (graphs??AI?? lol) And the constraint layout, from what I understand, is a heck of alot easier than I thought. I see its really powerful. It shares constraints and make it easier to have nested views.

  Databinding is easy. I can follow five steps, forgot but can google, and have the code be a value. 
  Accessibility helps people with disabilities. It has a lot of options, one is contentDescription. It is just an attribute to speaks the word the user touches I beilieve. 
  For different languages, use a different folder and name it with the IR code that is tradtional for other languages. Also, there is a translatable attribute and automirrored.
