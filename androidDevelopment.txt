 This is a new reflection file started for android Development. I have one hand-written, so I will keep updating that as well. But, I will update this one also to keep my skillset with git and github.

  Firstly, I need to learn how to use git and github with Android Studio. I will figure out when the time comes. I figure I can just create a repository and clone the package...hopefully.

  One of the things I learned today was the class R.id or R.layout..or I believe just "R"...its a reference for the resource folder..so thats why, when refering to a textview or string such as R.findViewByID.idk....its is refering to that.

  Mabye I should start dating these. (15 December 2017).
  I learned how to create an array in java. Something like Strings [] toyname = 'a'. It is very confusing when doings that instead of doing it in python, but I will manage. Also, in the Udacity tutorial, I got the Strings array from a class method from another file. Example: Strings [] toyname = toys.toyNames();. When I started android development in Java 4 or 5 years ago, I did not know what oys.toyNames() would come from. Now, I do. I learned a little something from classes in my intro to programming class, and it all makes sense now. When I looked at the Java class that I got the list of strings from, I can simply see myself doing it....Times have changed!

  I just want to reflect about adding a scroll view. It makes your content scroll. Its simply just adding a scroll view widget around the text view that we made equal an array of strings. That's it. It is not different textviews together. Huh..But I bet there is a different way of doing it. We will find out.

  Just checking in with the strings resource folder. I haven't been using this, but I should if I want my app to translate to other languages. I found that to make a string in the resource folder, just add one like the app name before..and the id is in quotations marks. If want to use, say on the XML layout, just put in quotations, @Strings/value. That is it.
