Now, Udacity is telling me to create a new file on github and reflect upon my ideas about remotes or when do I need one. From my understanding,
you only need yone when you are about to put your information into github or "push" it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 (Side note): This is the first question I put in my reflections file because I couldn't find the shortcut to copy and paste into git...so I didnt bother.
 It is best not to stay automcatically up-to-date because you don't know what changed if you constantly are being fed updates. You can easily have conflict detections if the project includes a large group of people.
