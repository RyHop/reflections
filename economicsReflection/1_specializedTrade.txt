 Hi, this is the start of a new chapter for me, and I am recording my reflections for learning economics. "Self-efficiency is inefficiency."- Adam Smith (Please forgive my spelling.) 

 In the 2nd Crash Course video, I learned that one country specializing making pizza is better off making that product and trading with another country who specializes in making shirts. Each country has a comparitive advantage that is good for both of them, and it is called mutually beneficial. 

 This is proof that a country can not do everything alone. I mean, it could, but it would be better off trading with other countries. To visualize this on a graph, people in economics use a PPF curve (possibilites frontier..forgot the whole acronym).
